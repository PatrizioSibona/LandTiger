# LandTiger V2.0 LPC1768 Development Board - LCD & TouchScreen Demo

The project aims at exploring some functionalities and features of the LandTiger development board, namely the GLCD and the TouchPanel peripherals.
This goal has been reached by building both low-level and high-level procedures, gathered in libraries with which we have interacted to create a straightforward game that highlights such functionalities.

The game at issue is the evergreen TicTacToe, choosen mostly because it allows us to check the accuracy of the inputs in an immediate fashion.
This work has been commisioned for us as a special project, during the Computer Architectures course at Politecnico di Torino, academic year 2017/2018.

## Getting Started

The project has been developed using ARM KEIL µVision4, a powerful IDE with built in functions and a large support for multiple devices.
It includes full support for the ULINK2, the external debugger we have been used.

## Deployment

We have loaded our code into the flash memory using the ULINK2 external debugger. 

## Built With

- KEIL µVision4 (http://www.keil.com/)
- Tera Term (https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en) used for serial communication
